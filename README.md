# Punk API 

A React application built during week 7-8 of my software development course at \_nology. 

This application allows you to search for and filter for your favorite Brewdog beers. It uses the [Brewdog Punk API](https://punkapi.com/).

This was an exercise in understanding component hierarchy in React and passing down state and functions as props.

Responsive on PC and Mobile. 


## Instructions

Enter your desired beer's name into the Search box. 

Click a filter checkbox to apply it if desired.
